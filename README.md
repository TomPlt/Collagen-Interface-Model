## Supplement Repository
This repository provides the simulation code and the mathematical definition of the in silico model used in the paper "Cell jamming in a collagen-based interface assay is tuned by collagen density and proteolysis" (https://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article/136/23/jcs260207/337775/Cell-jamming-in-a-collagen-based-interface-assay).
