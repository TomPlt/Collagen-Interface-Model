# Collagen-Interface-Model
## Supplement Repository
This repository provides the simulation code and the mathematical definition of the in silico model used in the article "Extracellular matrix guidance determines proteolytic and non-proteolytic cancer cell patterning" (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.16.484647v1). Videos of exemplary model realizations with different collagen densities and ECM degradation rates are provided.
